    """Pre-norm `Transformer encoder <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>`_ with `flash attention <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135>`_.

    Args:
        opts: Command line arguments.
        in_features: Number of channels in the input.
        head_dim: Head dimension in multi-head attention.
        attn_dropout_prob: Dropout rate for attention in multi-head attention. Default: 0.0
        qkv_features: Number of features after linear projection in QKV branch in multi-head
            attention. If none, qkv_features=in_features. Defaults to None.
        bias: Use bias. Defaults to False.
        dropout: Dropout rate. Defaults to 0.0.
        ffn_dropout: Dropout between FFN layers. Defaults to 0.0.
        ffn_multiplier: Multiplier for controlling the width in Feed-forward network (FFN). Defaults to 4.0.
        stochastic_dropout: Stochastic dropout setting. Default: 0.0.
        norm_layer_name: Normalization layer name. Defaults to "layer_norm".
        divisible_by: Ensure that FFN dimensions are divisible by this factor. Defaults to 16.

    ...note:
        * Enabling 'stochastic dropout' by setting 0 < stochastic_dropout < 1 drops the multi-head attention and feed-forward network
        layers, thus reducing the depth of the network during training. This is also known as `stochastic depth <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382v3>`_.
        On the other hand, 'dropout' drops the activations and do not change the depth of the network.

        * 'dropout', 'ffn_dropout', and 'stochastic_dropout' allows to address over-fitting issue. The values of these parameters
         are dependent on a task and should be chosen empirically.
